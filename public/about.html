<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Having been a gaming enthusiast from a young age, it was a matter of
  time until I would become interested in how these games work
  behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
  In May 2025 I decided to learn about game development as the indie gaming scene
  has become very successful and popular. Immediately I was bombarded with information ranging from
  what makes a successful game idea to what is the best game engine.
</p>

<p>
  Naturally, I picked what seemed the easiest and what my computer would run well: Godot. This is where
  my passion for programming was reignited and also learned how to use AI to be my tool rather than my replacement.
  I learnt to create a basic 3D character using AI and Adobe Mixamo.
</p>

<p>
  I shortly realised that programming was the most fun and awarding part of game development, and realised
  that I would like to code for a living. I enrolled myself into CS50, created a CodeWars account and 
  started exploring Pytho, C and a tiny bit of C++. I then came to the conclusion that the best course
  of action for me would be to focus on one study path so I picked fullstack web development. 
</p>

<p>
  The main reason for picking fullstack web development is the fact that it uses a wide range of tools 
  and programming languages, that would teach me important concepts that I may need for any programming role.
  The language you use isn't what is the most important (unless you do C++) but how you apply basic concepts
  in your language of choice.
